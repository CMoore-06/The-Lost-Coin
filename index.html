                <p class="verse"> “Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins[a] and loses one. Doesn’t she light a lamp, sweep
                    the house and search carefully until she finds it? 9 And when she finds it, she calls her friends and
                    neighbors together and says, ‘Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.’ 10 In the same way, I tell
                    you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”</p>

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <div id="bio" class="mb-3">
            <p>Lynette operates and manages The Lost Coin, LLC, deploying over 30+ years as a Certified Public
                Accountant (CPA). She has been licensed through the State of Missouri since 2013. She is also a
                Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE) credentialed by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, and she
                holds a Certificate in Financial Forensics (CFF) through the American Institute of Certified Public
                Accountants. Lynette obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Accountancy from the University of
                Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a Master of Science degree in Economic Crime Management from Utica
                College in New York.</p>

            <p>Lynette began her accounting career with then prestigious Arthur Andersen & Co as an auditor. She spent
                nearly 10 years in various internal audit, accounting, and finance positions at Hewlett-Packard Company,
                and also has extensive experience as a real estate investor. She has prepared hundreds of individual and
                corporate tax returns and payroll tax filings. More recently, she spent two years in New Orleans
                performing fraud investigation and forensic accounting work for the largest class-action court ordered
                settlement program in the history of the United States. She also spent nearly a year investigating
                allegations of embezzlement at a closely-held family business, identifying stolen funds in excess of
                $1.6 million along with fraudulently filed corporate tax returns and quarterly payroll reports. From her
                public accounting roots at the largest and most respected global accounting firm in the world to her
                years in Corporate America to her consulting experience with small family businesses, Lynette has
                developed a proven track record as a well-rounded finance professional.</p>

            <h5>Tax Resolution</h5>
            <p>For most people, dealing with the IRS isn’t fun or easy. And when you get audited, it can be overwhelming. You DON’T want to deal with your tax situation yourself… but you don’t want to pay high rates for someone else to handle it either! We’ve got you covered – we’re a local company that provides personalized tax resolution service at a fraction of the cost of those large national tax firms. Our team has decades of experience helping taxpayers just like you resolve their issues quickly and easily!</p>

            <h5>Forensic Accounting</h5>
            <p>The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners estimates that organizations lose at least 5% of their revenues to fraud each year. So, if your business is bringing in  $1 million in annual revenues, you could be losing $50,000 of those hard-earned dollars to occupational fraud – fraud committed by employees against their employers. All fraud is committed by a person in a position of trust.</p>
